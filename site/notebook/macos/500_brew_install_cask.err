Usage: brew install [options] formula|cask [...]

Install a formula or cask. Additional options specific to a formula may be
appended to the command.

Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK is set, brew upgrade or brew
reinstall will be run for outdated dependents and dependents with broken
linkage, respectively.

Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP is set, brew cleanup will then be run for
the installed formulae or, every 30 days, for all formulae.

Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_UPGRADE is set, brew install formula will
upgrade formula if it is already installed but outdated.

  -d, --debug                      If brewing fails, open an interactive
                                   debugging session with access to IRB or a
                                   shell inside the temporary build directory.
  -f, --force                      Install formulae without checking for
                                   previously installed keg-only or non-migrated
                                   versions. When installing casks, overwrite
                                   existing files (binaries and symlinks are
                                   excluded, unless originally from the same
                                   cask).
  -v, --verbose                    Print the verification and postinstall steps.
  -n, --dry-run                    Show what would be installed, but do not
                                   actually install anything.
      --formula, --formulae        Treat all named arguments as formulae.
      --ignore-dependencies        An unsupported Homebrew development flag to
                                   skip installing any dependencies of any kind.
                                   If the dependencies are not already present,
                                   the formula will have issues. If you're not
                                   developing Homebrew, consider adjusting your
                                   PATH rather than using this flag.
      --only-dependencies          Install the dependencies with specified
                                   options but do not install the formula
                                   itself.
      --cc                         Attempt to compile using the specified
                                   compiler, which should be the name of the
                                   compiler's executable, e.g. gcc-7 for GCC
                                   7. In order to use LLVM's clang, specify
                                   llvm_clang. To use the Apple-provided
                                   clang, specify clang. This option will only
                                   accept compilers that are provided by
                                   Homebrew or bundled with macOS. Please do not
                                   file issues if you encounter errors while
                                   using this option.
  -s, --build-from-source          Compile formula from source even if a
                                   bottle is provided. Dependencies will still
                                   be installed from bottles if they are
                                   available.
      --force-bottle               Install from a bottle if it exists for the
                                   current or newest version of macOS, even if
                                   it would not normally be used for
                                   installation.
      --include-test               Install testing dependencies required to run
                                   brew test formula.
      --HEAD                       If formula defines it, install the HEAD
                                   version, aka. main, trunk, unstable, master.
      --fetch-HEAD                 Fetch the upstream repository to detect if
                                   the HEAD installation of the formula is
                                   outdated. Otherwise, the repository's HEAD
                                   will only be checked for updates when a new
                                   stable or development version has been
                                   released.
      --keep-tmp                   Retain the temporary files created during
                                   installation.
      --debug-symbols              Generate debug symbols on build. Source will
                                   be retained in a cache directory. 
      --build-bottle               Prepare the formula for eventual bottling
                                   during installation, skipping any
                                   post-install steps.
      --bottle-arch                Optimise bottles for the specified
                                   architecture rather than the oldest
                                   architecture supported by the version of
                                   macOS the bottles are built on.
      --display-times              Print install times for each package at the
                                   end of the run.
  -i, --interactive                Download and patch formula, then open a
                                   shell. This allows the user to run
                                   ./configure --help and otherwise determine
                                   how to turn the software package into a
                                   Homebrew package.
  -g, --git                        Create a Git repository, useful for creating
                                   patches to the software.
      --overwrite                  Delete files that already exist in the prefix
                                   while linking.
      --cask, --casks              Treat all named arguments as casks.

                                   that are identical to those being installed.
                                   Cannot be combined with --force.
      --skip-cask-deps             Skip installing cask dependencies.
